My personal dotfiles.

## Installation

You need to clone the repository into `~/github/dotfiles` and `make all`.

## Neovim Steps
First start will display errors because all plugins are missing
`:PlugInstall`

- :TSInstall <language_to_install>
    - ensure_installed = { "c", "lua", "vim", "help" }
